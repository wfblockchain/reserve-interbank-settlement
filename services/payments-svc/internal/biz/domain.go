// Package biz is the payment hub's business layer: the payment-order
// lifecycle a corporate treasury and a bank's operations staff work
// through, the controls banks apply, and the treasury and operator operations
// behind it.
//
// Corporate clients see deposit accounts and payment orders only. Underneath,
// an urgent payment to another bank is a conversion: the paying bank
// tokenizes the deposit as its deposit token, the conversion bridge burns it,
// moves settlement money between the banks and mints the receiving bank's
// deposit token in one transaction, and the receiving bank redeems it
// straight into the payee's account. A normal payment is an obligation
// between the banks that settles net in the operator's next cycle. Repository
// interfaces are implemented in data/, the settlement rails in rails/, OFAC
// screening in sanctions/, and ISO 20022 documents in iso/.
