# Clearing-House Settlement Token — Reference Model

A reference implementation of a common interbank settlement asset of the kind a
clearing utility (e.g. a TCH-style operator) would issue: a **par-valued,
permissioned token** with a **separate yield-accrual index**, an **obligation
netting engine**, and **atomic delivery-versus-payment** — plus the off-chain
netting optimiser and an economics simulator that measures, rather than asserts,
what the design is worth.

Self-contained: no proprietary dependencies, no external services. Solidity via
Foundry; Go for the netting optimiser, the economics simulator, and a member
bank's payment hub that drives the contracts end to end
([services/payments-svc](services/payments-svc/README.md)).

## The thesis

A transferable claim gets a market; a market prices the claim in real time. So
**which claim you make transferable decides where run risk lives**:

- **Transferable deposit tokens (M2)** give every issuing bank stablecoin-like
  run dynamics. The moment Bank C's token prints 98.4¢ in stress, everyone sees
  it and everyone exits first — a live price feed on each bank's credit is a run
  accelerant by design.
- **A transferable pool claim (M0)** has no single-bank credit to run on. A
  market in it prices nothing bank-specific; the residual risks — the operator
  and the account structure — are governed, not market-priced.

```mermaid

    T["Make a claim transferable"] --> M["A market prices it, in real time"]
    M --> Q{"What does that market price?"}
    Q -->|"deposit token (M2)"| R1["Each issuing bank's credit —<br/>a live price feed on bank stress<br/>= a run accelerant by design"]
    Q -->|"pool claim (M0)"| R2["Nothing bank-specific —<br/>residual risks (operator, account structure)<br/>are governed, not market-priced"]
```

So the settlement tier should be the **transferable** one and the deposit tier
the **constrained** one — the opposite of where the industry is currently
investing. This repo implements the transferable core that thesis calls for.

## The bar it must clear

Instant, final, 24×7 settlement in central-bank money already exists: RTP has
settled through a prefunded joint account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York since 2017 — an account on which **the Fed pays interest** (the live
precedent for this repo's accrual index). An "M0 network" pitched on speed or
finality is that rail with a token wrapper. Where the dollars actually move:

| Rail | Daily value | Payments/day | Avg payment | Cap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Fedwire | ~$4.7tn | ~836k | ~$5.6m | — |
| CHIPS | ~$2.0tn | ~566k | $3.4m | — |
| RTP | ~$5.5bn | ~1.5m | ≈$3.7k | $10m |

The instant rail carries ~0.3% of wholesale daily value and is structurally
capped out of it. The defensible surface for a token layer is therefore what a
rail cannot do: **payments above $10m, atomic DvP against tokenized assets,
obligation netting, conditional (escrowed) execution, and yield distributed to
the holder-of-record.** Those five capabilities are exactly what these
contracts implement.

## The three mechanisms this repo makes executable

**1. Par is preserved while economics travel with the token.**
Both market-standard yield mechanisms break a settlement asset: exchange-rate
accrual (ERC-4626-style) pushes the unit off par so units minted at different
times stop being fungible; rebasing changes balances underneath every contract
holding one. `SettlementToken` keeps the unit at exactly one dollar and tracks
yield in a separate per-unit index, synced on both sides of every transfer — so
income credits **whoever held the token during each period**, not the original
contributor, and yield **never mints** (units with no reserve behind them would
break the backing invariant `totalSupply == reservePool`). If the pool ends up
in a non-interest-bearing account, the index simply stops advancing — no
migration, no contract change.

**2. Netting is impossible if submitting a payment moves tokens.**
`burn → mint → fail if short` is gross settlement; its efficiency is 1:1 by
construction. `NettingEngine` holds **obligations, not tokens**: submission
moves nothing, cycles settle only net positions, and any participant can pull an
obligation out for immediate gross settlement (`forceGross`) at the cost of
funding it in full. Netting is a prefunded system's substitute for the daylight
credit that Fedwire provides and a token pool cannot.

**3. The chain does not trust the optimiser.**
Choosing which obligations to settle is a search problem and runs off-chain
(`internal/clearing`). Verifying the answer is a linear scan and runs on-chain:
`settleCycle` recomputes net positions from the discharged obligations and
rejects anything that does not follow from them. A compromised optimiser cannot
move value the obligations do not imply.

`NettingPlanBook` removes the remaining monopoly — *who proposes the plan*.
A selection window opens per cycle (measured in blocks, not seconds — a
timestamp is the producer's to shade); any solver submits a plan, which is
verified at submission exactly as the engine verifies it at settlement; the
plan discharging the most gross value leads, and once the window closes
anyone may execute the winner through the engine. A sole optimiser was never
a correctness risk — the engine checks the math — but it was an *optimality*
monopoly: if it found 24:1 where 29:1 existed, nobody could prove value was
left on the table. Competing solvers make the search adversarial, and the
winning score is a public record of the best plan anyone could find.

## The role in a two-tier system: the conversion layer

M0 and M2 are complementary tiers, and the open question is whether movement
between them can get efficient enough that institutions keep deposit economics
with near-M0 finality. In that architecture an interbank transfer of edge money
is never a *transfer* at all — it is an atomic **burn at Bank A → settle A→B in
the pool claim → mint at Bank B**, so no interbank claim outlives a transaction
and bank credit never trades. Conversion flows are dense and offsetting, which
is precisely what the netting engine exploits. This repo's four components —
par token, accrual index, netting engine, atomic DvP — are the conversion
layer's mechanisms.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DA["Deposit token<br/>Bank A's customer (M2)"] -->|"burn at A"| CORE["Pool claim (M0)<br/>settle A→B, netted<br/>with every other conversion"]
    CORE -->|"mint at B"| DB["Deposit token<br/>Bank B's customer (M2)"]
```

One atomic operation: the customer sees an instant payment, no interbank claim
outlives the transaction, and par between the banks' tokens holds by mechanism.

That conversion layer is now executable. **`DepositToken`** is one bank's
tokenized deposit — minted against deposits taken, burned against
withdrawals, gated to that bank's own customers, paying deposit interest
through the same accrual-index mechanics at the bank's own rate.
Deliberately, it has **no backing invariant**: it is a chartered bank's
liability, backed by the bank's balance sheet — money creation lives at this
tier, where it is licensed, capitalized and insured, and nowhere else.
Interbank transfer is structurally impossible (each bank's token is its own
contract, gated to its own customers), so a cross-bank payment can only be a
conversion: **`ConversionBridge`** burns at Bank A, moves settlement money
A→B over the settlement path, and mints at Bank B — one transaction or none,
with every tier's gates binding on its own leg and **no rate parameter
anywhere on the path**. The bridge is deliberately dumb: if the sending
bank's settlement balance is short, the conversion reverts — funding that
leg is the elasticity stack's job (netting, then collateralized intraday
liquidity, then elastic backing), never the seam's.

## The derivatives layer: physically-settled forwards and swaps

Most of the FX market is not spot: swaps and forwards — commitments about
future settlement — dominate turnover, and they need settlement money only
at settlement instants. `FxForward` builds the two dominant instruments on
the settlement tokens, on one deliberate design line:

**Physical settlement only.** Every settlement exchanges BOTH principals in
full, atomically, in the two currencies' settlement tokens. The contract
holds no oracle, no fixing, and no rate object — only the principal amounts
agreed at inception (the implied rate is their ratio, fixed forever). This
is the exempt shape of FX derivatives: physically-settled forwards and swaps
sit outside the statutory swap perimeter, while cash-settled instruments —
NDFs, options, anything settling a difference — do not, and are deliberately
not implemented.

- **Forwards** follow the bound-trade lifecycle: propose (revocable offer) →
  bind (mutual obligation) → settle on/after the value date (either party
  triggers; each currency's gates, freezes and accrual run on its own leg) →
  or cancel (bilateral while live, unilateral once lapsed).
- **Swaps are two exchanges, not a new instrument**: accepting a swap
  settles the near leg in the same transaction and creates the far leg as an
  already-bound forward with roles reversed. Between the legs each party
  holds the other's currency and earns that token's accrual index — the
  carry travels through the indices (covered interest parity, mechanical),
  pinned by test.

**The urgent lane is a declining-price auction** (`FxDutchLane`): an
urgent seller opens an order whose rate decays from a seller-favorable
start toward a chosen floor — by **block height, never timestamp** (a
producer can shade timestamps; block numbers it cannot) — and the first
admitted filler to accept wins both legs atomically at the current rate.
Immediacy is priced by open competition with worst-case slippage bounded
by the floor; an optional exclusivity window gives one filler a brief
first look (the RFQ hybrid) before the public decay disciplines its
quote. No operator exists in this lane: any member opens for itself, any
member fills.

**The client-order primitive is an intent** (`FxIntent`): a client posts
constraints — amount, limit rate, expiry — and any admitted filler executes
within them. Nothing moves until a filler satisfies the constraints in full
and atomically, a fill below the limit cannot exist, and a fill above it
pays its surplus to the client — the floor is law, competition sets the
rest. This is the enabling primitive of the long-tail hedging channel: a
per-invoice hedge is one posted intent, not a phone call, and a standing
treasury policy is a stream of them. The production path adds Permit2-style
off-chain signatures and the ERC-7683 order shape; the constraint semantics
are this contract's.

**Standing orders are that stream, implemented** (`FxStandingOrder` +
`TwapPolicy`): a member registers a policy once — a TWAP, a scheduled
hedge — and the policy turns the clock into tranches, each with its own
limit floor and fill window. The policy is consulted *inside* the fill
transaction, so validity is re-derived at settlement and the poller is
never trusted — the same stance the netting engine takes toward its
optimiser. Front-loading is impossible because the current tranche is a
pure function of the clock; double-filling is impossible because the
registry keeps one bit per tranche; and an owner-level **guard** screens
every fill of every standing order the member has — the on-chain seat for
a member's whitelist policy, fail-closed. Policies tell their poller when
to come back through typed scheduling reverts (try-at-epoch, never) —
scheduled re-evaluation, not dumb polling. Adapted from ComposableCoW's
conditional-order framework, with its generate/verify split collapsed
into one call because this order flow settles where it is posted.

Three client-side stances run across the whole market layer, each pinned
by test: **proceeds deliver to a named receiver** (an intent, an urgent
order, a standing tranche, and each forward leg can pay a designated
beneficiary directly — convert-and-deliver is one atomic settlement, and
the receiver passes the delivering currency's admission gate like any
recipient); **rounding always favors the client's leg** (the professional
side carries the dust, never the client); and **contract accounts are
first-class members** (membership is address-based, so a quorum-controlled
treasury wallet posts, receives and revokes under its own on-chain
approval policy — no signature machinery required).

Known limit, stated plainly: no variation margin — between bind and
settlement the parties carry replacement-cost exposure, as in any
uncollateralized bilateral forward. Production wants VM posted in the
settlement token (where it would earn the accrual index while pledged) and
close-out netting semantics; both are design extensions, not code.

## Elasticity: how a fully-backed system breathes

The strongest objection to a prefunded settlement tier is locked money: the
pool must be sized to **peak** gross demand, and every parked dollar above
usage is sterilized balance sheet. Today's system hides the cost — the Fed
prices collateralized daylight overdrafts at zero precisely so banks need not
hoard — and a token pool inherits none of that machinery.

The tempting fix is the wrong one. Making the settlement claim *fractional* —
claims exceeding backing — would make it run-prone by theorem: a demandable
par claim against assets that cannot all liquidate at par, with no deposit
insurance and no lender of last resort, is the Diamond–Dybvig setup with the
protective institutions deleted. It would relocate run risk to the core,
inverting the thesis this design stands on. The resolution is a distinction
the fractional framing hides:

> Fractional reserve bundles three things — credit intermediation, deposit
> creation, maturity transformation. A settlement system needs only a timing
> bridge. **Elasticity of funding, not elasticity of money.**

Money creation stays where it is chartered, capitalized and insured; the
settlement tier gets funding elasticity from mechanisms that never break its
backing invariant:

    M2T --> K1["DepositToken has NO backing invariant —<br/>deliberately: it is a bank liability"]
    M0T --> K2["four mechanisms below —<br/>none ever mints against nothing"]
```

### The four mechanisms, in the order they absorb demand

**1. Netting** *(implemented — `NettingEngine` + `internal/clearing`).*
Obligations queue and offset; only residuals fund. Measured ~9:1 here at
batch cycles; the production ceiling is CHIPS-like 29:1. The single biggest
lever, and the reason the pool is sized to residuals rather than peaks.

**2. Idle-balance intermediation** *(implemented —
`IntradayLiquidityPool`).* Cash-rich members deposit spare M0 single-sided
into a native **ERC-4626** vault — standard shares any allocator can read,
but membership-gated, because a pool receipt is not a bearer asset. A short
member draws against registered tokenized collateral at a haircut, intraday,
at a kinked utilization-curve rate fixed at draw time — governance sets the
curve, nobody sets prices — and repays from incoming flows. A payment may be
funded part own-balance, part draw — a daylight overdraft with a down
payment. Total M0 is conserved (pinned by test): the pool reallocates
existing balances, so this is the *intermediation* half of fractional
reserve with the *creation* half amputated. A draw that outlives the
operational day accrues at a penalty multiple; past a grace window anyone
may seize its collateral for the pool, and any shortfall lands on LP share
price — the members priced the risk, the operator never carries it. Its
limit is honest: total draws ≤ pool deposits, so it needs the next layer
behind it.

**3. Elastic backing** *(design — `fundInKind`/`defundInKind` on the
token).* When the whole system is short, supply itself breathes — against
collateral, never against nothing. The clearing house takes tokenized
Treasuries in via atomic DvP repo, mints M0 at a haircut, and burns on the
same-day unwind. The backing invariant generalizes from
`totalSupply == reservePool` to `totalSupply == cash + haircut(HQLA)`:
composition varies intraday, full backing never lapses. This is the elastic-
currency answer — supply against collateral — not the fractional one, and
its operational precedent (intraday tokenized repo) already runs at hundreds
of billions per day in production systems.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BK as Member bank
    participant CH as Clearing house
    participant TOK as SettlementToken
    BK->>CH: tokenized Treasuries, repo leg in
    CH->>TOK: fundInKind - mint at a haircut
    Note over TOK: totalSupply == cash + haircut(HQLA) - fully backed, composition shifted
    BK->>BK: settle the day's payments with the minted M0
    BK->>CH: repo unwind, same day
    CH->>TOK: defundInKind - burn, Treasuries released
    Note over TOK: supply breathed with demand and never exceeded backing
```

**4. Committed standby liquidity** *(design — a registry and a fee
schedule).* Designated members sell committed intraday lines: standby fees
in calm, mandatory provision in stress. The tail is priced instead of
prefunded, and drawing a line carries no stigma because it exercises a
paid-for right.

### How the stack composes

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    D["settlement demand<br/>peak gross: 3.0bn"] -->|"most payments offset"| N["netting<br/>(implemented)"]
    N -->|"residual positions ~400m"| P["idle-balance pool<br/>(implemented)<br/>borrow existing M0 vs collateral"]
    P -->|"unmet timing gap ~250m"| E["elastic backing<br/>mint vs Treasuries, burn on unwind"]
    E -->|"stress tail"| C["committed standby lines<br/>priced, not prefunded"]
    C --> F["parked-cash floor ~100m<br/>earning the accrual index"]
```

Order of magnitude, the parked-cash requirement falls ~30× from naive
peak-prefunding — and the floor that remains is remunerated through the
accrual index, so even it is not dead weight. Two properties hold at every
layer: **no claim ever exists without backing behind it** (the run-proofness
of the core is never traded for liquidity), and **the conversion seam stays
dumb** (a short settlement leg reverts; elasticity operates behind the
bridge, never inside it).

The honest limit: no pool is a central bank. This stack compresses and
remunerates the need for liquidity; it does not manufacture a lender of last
resort, and nothing in it depends on being granted one.

## Cross-currency: PvP and the residual auction

The same mechanics extend across currencies. Two findings, both pinned by
tests:

**Gross PvP needs zero new code.** A second currency's settlement token is a
plain `IERC20`, so it rides `AtomicDvP`'s asset leg unchanged: both cash legs
settle in one transaction or neither (Herstatt risk is unconstructable, not
managed), and *both* jurisdictions' admission gates, freezes and accrual sync
run on their own legs — a cross-border payment passes both regulators' controls
atomically or does not move.

**Conversion pricing is `FxBatchAuction`.** Cross-currency flows should be
netted and crossed at a reference mid first; only the residual imbalance needs
a market. The auction sells that residual under three commitments:

- **The operator is auctioneer, never principal** — the contract quotes
  nothing and holds no inventory; it cannot lose money on markets, which is
  what keeps the utility credit-neutral.
- **Sealed bids, because the ledger is shared** — a visible bid is a free
  option to everyone else, so bids commit as hashes and reveal after the
  window closes; unrevealed bids lapse.
- **The operator proposes, the chain verifies** — `settleBatch` takes the
  operator's fill order but requires a complete, rate-sorted permutation of
  every revealed bid (the `settleCycle` trust split, transplanted), then fills
  greedily and clears **every winner at the marginal accepted rate**. Uniform
  pricing removes the incentive to shade and the reward for speed; a batch has
  no queue. Firm quotes need no last-look — a winning reveal settles
  atomically in the same transaction.

The waterfall — price as little as possible:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    G["gross cross-currency<br/>flows, both directions"] --> N["net + cross at mid<br/>most cancels — zero spread"]
    N --> R["residual<br/>imbalance"]
    R --> A["sealed-bid batch auction<br/>uniform marginal price"]
    A --> P["atomic PvP<br/>both gates, one tx — or neither"]
    R -.->|"urgent payment"| Q["RFQ gross lane<br/>AtomicDvP unchanged, immediacy priced"]
    Q --> P
```

One batch end to end, with the numbers the tests pin:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant OP as Operator
    participant AU as FxBatchAuction
    participant LP as LP banks
    participant TR as Treasury
    OP->>AU: openBatch(id, treasury, 800m USD, windows)
    LP->>AU: commitBid(hash), three bidders
    Note over AU: sealed - a visible bid on a shared ledger is a free option
    LP->>AU: revealBid(rate, amount, salt)
    Note over AU: 0.9300 for 400m, 0.9210 for 300m, 0.9100 for 300m
    OP->>AU: settleBatch(id, fillOrder)
    Note over AU: verified - a complete, rate-sorted permutation of every reveal
    Note over AU: greedy fill 400+300+100, clearing rate 0.9100 for every winner
    AU->>TR: EUR 728.0m = 800m x 0.9100 (settlementTransfer)
    AU->>LP: USD 400m / 300m / 100m, each paid at 0.9100
```

Because each currency's pool runs its own accrual index at its own
policy-proximate rate, the index differential is the forward points — covered
interest parity by arithmetic — and an FX swap decomposes into a spot PvP plus
a scheduled reverse PvP, with the indices carrying the carry in between.

## Measured, not asserted

`go run ./cmd/clearing-operator` reproduces the economics (20 participants,
5,000 payments, skewed values):

- Netting cuts **turnover ~9×** ($17.6bn → $2.0bn moved for the same value
  settled) at batch cycle size 1,000; cycle size 1 measures exactly 1.0:1,
  which is the model checking itself against gross settlement.
- **Peak drawdown barely moves** ($343m → $335m): a net payer still funds its
  closing position. The netting ratio reduces intraday turnover, not
  end-of-day funding — quoting it otherwise would not survive a treasurer.
- On a $10bn pool at 4%, the pool either distributes **$32.9m per 30 days**
  through the accrual index or that sum is the participants' cost. The
  contracts are identical either way — and the live precedent favours
  distribution: a bank-owned joint settlement account at the Fed already earns
  master-account-equivalent interest (Board order, June 2023), paid to the
  account's owners. That order passes interest back by *funder*; a circulating
  claim needs it by *holder-of-record*, which is what the accrual index is.

## The shape of the code — three contracts, one choke point

Every value movement, from every contract, terminates on the token's single
`_update` pipeline. There is no second path — which is the auditability
argument in one picture.

## Two concepts, one seam

The source tree separates two different things that depend on each other,
so a reader is never confused about which is which:

- **`contracts/src/clearing/`** — the money: the settlement token, the
  netting engine, DvP settlement, the deposit tier and the conversion
  bridge. **No rate object exists anywhere in this directory** — nothing
  here can price.
- **`contracts/src/market/`** — the pricing: the residual auction and the
  physically-settled forwards/swaps. **Nothing here holds custody or mints**
  — no money is created on this side.

The only coupling is the `SETTLEMENT_ROLE` grant: market contracts settle
*through* the clearing layer, through the same governed gate as any other
settling contract. The seam tests (two-token PvP, freeze-stops-the-batch,
carry-through-indices) deliberately live in one suite so the boundary is
continuously proven, not assumed. If the two layers ever diverge in
governance — separate operators, separate auditors, production hardening,
or an external adopter of one side — the directory boundary is where the
repository splits.

## The payment hub

`services/payments-svc` is a member bank's payment hub over these contracts:
go-kratos with proto-first APIs (HTTP and gRPC), Wire, Ent on Postgres, and
moov-io for ISO 20022, OFAC screening, routing numbers and the Fed calendar.
`services/payments-portal` is its web front end.

Corporate clients send payment orders by API or pain.001 file and never see a
token. An urgent payment to another bank is a **conversion** (the paying
bank's deposit token burned, settlement money moved, the receiving bank's
minted, in one transaction); a normal one is an **obligation** that settles
net in the operator's next cycle, chosen through the **plan book** and
re-verified by the engine. A bank's treasury funds settlement money over
Fedwire or FedNow, draws **intraday liquidity** against collateral when it is
short and Fedwire is shut, and defunds under maker-checker; the operator
reconciles the Fed reserve account against the token's reserve pool and
passes **reserve interest** through the accrual index.

Its black-box end-to-end test runs a business week against anvil: netting,
an OFAC block, a Saturday $25m payment released by an intraday draw, a
closed account, funding and a defund, interest passed through pro rata, and
reconciliation to the cent. A chaos suite (`make chaos` in the service) runs
the same hub through lost RPC replies, failing receipts and reads, a locked
database, concurrency and a crash, and checks that client money is conserved
and the reserve account reconciles after every one. See
[services/payments-svc/README.md](services/payments-svc/README.md).

## Run it

```bash
# Contracts (Foundry via Docker; or `forge test` if installed)
cd contracts && docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:stable "forge test"

# Go: netting optimiser, simulation, and the contract wiring against anvil
ANVIL_BIN=$(command -v anvil) go test ./...

# The economics tables
go run ./cmd/clearing-operator

# The payment hub and its black-box end-to-end test
(cd services/payments-svc && make build-demo && ./bin/payments-svc -conf configs)
(cd services/payments-svc && make e2e)
```

Dependencies under `contracts/dependencies/` are soldeer-managed and not
committed; `forge soldeer install` restores them (pins in `foundry.toml`).

## Standards and interoperability position

Built as plain OpenZeppelin ERC-20 + AccessControl, implementing the
**ERC-7943 (uRWA)** fungible interface — gate, freeze, forced transfer — with
two mechanisms ported from **ERC-3643**: key-loss recovery (`recoverBalance`)
and partial freeze. ERC-3643's full identity stack (six mandatory contracts plus
an ONCHAINID per holder) is deliberately not adopted: a settlement asset has a
few dozen holders, each an admitted institution under a legal agreement — a
membership list, not a claims registry. Expect the *securities* leg of a DvP to
be ERC-3643; the `AtomicDvP` asset leg is plain `IERC20` so such tokens work
unchanged, and their compliance checks propagate (an ineligible buyer reverts
both legs).

Cross-chain, the token should exist on another chain only as **the same
instrument natively issued there**: burned on one chain and minted on the
other, never wrapped around a locked token. This repo implements no
cross-chain path; the position is:

- **Default: attested burn-and-mint with two independent keys.** Every mint
  needs a strict majority of the operator's attesters **and** the issuer's own
  key. Each signer reads the source chain from nodes it runs itself, and signs
  only after source-chain finality.
- **Tokens are locked, not burned, until the destination mint is proven.** A
  mint that never happens unlocks at the source after a deadline, with proof
  that the destination can no longer mint it.
- **Losses are bounded where tokens are minted.** Each chain has a supply cap
  and an inbound mint rate limit per corridor, and the home side refuses any
  mint beyond what was finally burned elsewhere. Limits on outgoing transfers
  alone do not stop a forged inbound message.
- **Light-client channels (IBC-style)** replace attester trust for a corridor
  once that light client has been audited. Each chain then verifies the
  other's consensus, and relayers can delay but not forge.
- **Venue synchronizers** (Canton-style) apply where a counter-venue requires
  one.
- **Third-party message networks** carry messages and never authorize them.
  A network that lets the issuer require its own verifier on every message is
  acceptable; one whose own attestation authorizes the mint is not.
- **HTLCs** are the last resort.

Same-ledger DvP is the only unconditional rung. Every cross-chain claim of
atomicity should name the trust assumption it stands on.

## On-chain versus messaging: what actually changes

The honest framing first: a shared ledger changes nothing about what banking
*is* — credit judgment, inventory risk and admission decisions all remain —
and changes almost everything about how banking *coordinates*. Every benefit
in this repository traces to one root difference:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T["TODAY<br/>many ledgers, synced by messages<br/>message &ne; settlement"] --> G["the gap:<br/>reconciliation &middot; Herstatt windows<br/>delay &middot; trapped prefunding"]
    C["ON-CHAIN<br/>one shared state<br/>the record IS the money"] --> B["the gap closed:<br/>atomic legs &middot; embedded rules<br/>verified operators &middot; earning money &middot; 24&times;7"]
```

Six mechanism shifts follow, each pinned by a test in this repo rather than
asserted:

| # | Today (messaging) | On-chain (shared state) | Where pinned |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Many ledgers kept in sync by messages; drift, reconciliation, delay | One state — the record is the money; reconciliation ceases as a category | every balance test |
| 2 | Two legs, two systems, two times: Herstatt risk, batch-window patches | Both legs in one transaction or neither; conditional settlement is structural | DvP/PvP/conversion atomicity tests |
| 3 | Compliance around the payment: screen before, audit after, strand mid-chain | Gates inside the transfer — a non-compliant payment cannot partially exist; both jurisdictions bind atomically | gate/freeze tests on every leg |
| 4 | Operator behavior policed by audit after the fact; rivals refuse shared venues | Operator powers verified at execution: sealed bids, checked fill order — trust becomes technical | auction no-reorder/no-omission tests |
| 5 | Idle prefunded balances, batch interest, collateral dead while pledged | Yield travels with the token: balances earn their index, CIP holds by arithmetic | accrual and carry tests |
| 6 | Hours plus patches: cutoffs, batch windows, weekend liquidity workarounds | The machine does not close; prefunding compressed by the elasticity stack | netting + elasticity design |

And what does **not** improve — the list that makes the rest credible:
market risk is untouched (inventory is inventory; the model removes
frictional cost, never price risk); credit judgment is untouched; liquidity
is still required at settlement instants — atomicity *tightens* the funding
requirement, which is exactly why the elasticity stack exists. Four things
get genuinely harder: privacy (bilateral opacity was a feature; the public
obligation graph is this repo's first stated limit), operational risk
changes shape (key custody and contract correctness replace reconciliation
error), irreversibility cuts both ways (recovery is a governed forced
transfer, not a courtesy recall), and finality in code is not yet finality
in law everywhere.

None of this is blockchain ideology. Three engineering properties do all the
work — **shared state, atomic execution, rules embedded in the asset** — and
each claim above reduces to a checkable test, which is how the question
"is on-chain better?" stays an engineering question instead of a belief.

## Position among adjacent projects

The tokenized-money landscape is rich, and each major project has proven a
piece of this architecture in production. Stated factually — what each
demonstrates, and what it leaves out of scope:

| Project | What it demonstrates | Out of its scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Fnality** | The M0 anchor: settlement in central-bank funds via an omnibus account (GBP live) | The deposit tier, conversion, obligation netting, FX pricing, elasticity |
| **Partior** | A live multi-currency interbank ledger | Settles in commercial-bank money — credit inside the core; no netting engine; JV rather than mutual governance |
| **Kinexys / single-bank token services** | Intraday tokenized repo and intra-bank tokenized money at real scale | Interbank settlement between competing issuers — a single bank's token cannot be neutral infrastructure for its rivals |
| **Payment stablecoins** | 24×7 corridor payments at low cost | Bank-grade governance; obligation netting; and yield to holders, which the applicable statutes prohibit for them and permit for a bank settlement asset |
| **Regulated Liability Network (UK)** | Multi-bank liabilities recorded on one ledger, with central-bank participation | The elasticity layer, explicitly; still in experimentation |
| **Project Agorá** | Official-sector blessing for tokenized deposits + reserves on a unified ledger, multi-currency, real-value trials | FX price discovery; netting; official-sector timelines apply |
| **DeFi lending/lease protocols** | Single-sided pools, utilization pricing, collateralized leases, partial liquidation — mechanics this repo ports | A regulated monetary instrument for those mechanics to act on |

What this reference model contributes that none of the above combines:

1. **The transferability inversion, implemented.** The settlement tier is the
   transferable instrument; the deposit tier is constrained by construction
   (per-bank contracts make interbank M2 transfer unrepresentable). Par
   between banks' tokens is arithmetic — there is no rate anywhere to break,
   so no secondary market in bank credit can form.
2. **Netting as a first-class mode.** An obligation engine whose cycles are
   recomputed and verified on-chain — the largest liquidity lever in
   clearing, absent from every token project above.
3. **A named, ordered elasticity stack** with a fully-backed invariant at
   every layer, and the fractional alternative rejected on explicit
   theoretical grounds rather than left unexamined.
4. **Conversion pricing inside the settlement machine.** A sealed-bid,
   uniform-price residual auction whose fill order the chain verifies —
   settlement and price discovery in one atomic system, where adjacent
   projects settle FX that was priced elsewhere.
5. **A credit-neutral operator whose powers are verified, not trusted.** The
   operator cannot quote, trade, reorder or omit; every discretionary
   surface is either removed or checked on-chain.
6. **Falsifiability.** Measured economics from a runnable simulator, 49
   pinning tests, and a limits section that says what is design versus code.

The honest counterweight: the projects above have production volumes,
licenses and central-bank relationships; this is a reference model. The
claim is not deployment maturity — it is design completeness. Each adjacent
project validates a component of this architecture in production; this
repository is, to our knowledge, the only public codebase that composes the
components — money design, market design, elasticity, governance — into one
system with its invariants pinned by tests.

## Known limits, stated plainly

- **The obligation graph is public to chain participants** (payer, payee,
  amount). Deployable versions need commit-reveal, ZK netting, or a
  privacy-native venue. This gates any pilot.
- **No default waterfall.** Deferred settlement creates payee credit exposure
  between submit and cycle; a reverted cycle protects the ledger, not the payee
  who waited. Production needs net debit caps and loss-sharing rules.
- **Obligations do not expire on chain**, and the operator can `forceGross`
  any queued obligation — needs TTLs and a payer-revocation window. The
  payment hub enforces a time-to-live off chain (it cancels and refunds).
- **Plan-to-execution race:** balances can move between the optimiser's plan and
  `settleCycle`; the revert is atomic and safe, but production wants balance
  reservation.
- Gridlock resolution is a greedy heuristic (feasible and deterministic, not
  optimal). The simulator models random flow, not strategic queue management —
  batch cycles reach ~9:1 efficiency, not a CHIPS-like 29:1.
- Accrual is one-directional (no negative rates, no on-chain fees), and any
  contract that holds balances across time accrues yield to itself — forward
  entitlement or keep custody transient.
- **The auction batch is only as strong as its weakest winner**: a revealed
  bidder whose balance no longer covers its fill reverts the whole
  `settleBatch` — atomicity kept honest at the price of a stall. Production
  wants bid bonds posted at commitment.
- **The reference mid is a governance problem, not a contract**: crossing at
  mid (upstream of the auction) needs a rate source with the same
  "verified, not trusted" treatment as the optimiser — e.g. a bounded median
  of member submissions — which this repo does not implement.
- **Elasticity beyond netting and the pool is specified, not implemented**:
  elastic backing (`fundInKind`) and the committed-line registry above are
  design mechanisms with stated invariants; netting and the idle-balance
  pool ship in this repo. And the pool's own limit is stated in its tests:
  seized collateral is recovery held as a token — converting it back to M0
  happens off the pool's books, via DvP.
- **A 24×7 token redeems into banking-hours money**: `defund` promises fiat and
  Fedwire closes. Redemption windows or an intraday facility are a policy
  choice the contracts do not make.
- **Legal classification is unresolved.** The settlement token is a claim on
  a pooled central-bank balance, not a deposit at a bank.
  - The GENIUS Act's definition of a payment stablecoin excludes "a deposit
    … including a deposit recorded using distributed ledger technology"
    ([Pub. L. 119-27 §2(22)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-119publ27/html/PLAW-119publ27.htm)).
    This token is not obviously such a deposit.
  - The FDIC's April 2026 tokenized-deposit proposal asks whether a token that
    *represents* a claim on a deposit, rather than being the deposit, could be
    a stablecoin instead.
  - So it is open whether the token falls outside the stablecoin definition
    or its issuer must be a permitted payment-stablecoin issuer. That needs a
    legal opinion before any pilot.
